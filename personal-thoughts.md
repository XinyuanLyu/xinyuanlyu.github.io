### The Priority of Self-Reference and the Necessity of Proper Names

A primordial identity is self-identity, and a primordial immediate reference is the object's self-reference. If the identity of an object is recognized, then the object's reference to itself is indeed a necessary, non-mediated, immediate reference. This is because the split between the object itself and its name is a self-division, a process that does not rely on anything outside the object. Although there is, after all, a primordial difference between my name and myself—a difference that precisely negates the primordial self-identity—this difference is negated once again in the process of self-reference. The primordial naming or referring activity of "I am I" undoubtedly expresses the self's declaration of its own identity through a mode of division (the division of my name from me). Such an expression is immediate, yet to achieve this immediate expression, the self is compelled to undergo self-division. The indexical "I," therefore, holds a status of priority.

However, I cannot remain merely in absolute isolation. The self always exceeds itself, dealing with the non-self—that is, the Other—and is thus compelled to enter the domain of difference. In this domain, every individual object, possessing equal status in personhood, issues a declaration of its own identity through "I." Yet, each declaration, when received by individuals other than oneself, naturally marks a difference and an alterity, while simultaneously marking the self-identity of that alien object. Thus, for an individual, the plural "I"s of others constitute the primordial naming of the Other; that is, I use the "I" of the other/object as the proper name for that object. The proper name is separated from self-reference for the first time. We collectively call this "He." "He" is a necessary reference to the object because "He" is merely another persona of this unconditional self-reference; thus, it is also necessary. It does not depend on any description or property. "He" originates from the necessity of self-reference and the difference brought about by plural self-references—my self-reference is unique, whereas in the self-references of other objects, I perceive that immediate naming activity and name. These names, which possess the efficacy of pointing directly to the object itself, are what I call "He." That is to say, "He," in its fullest sense, is the indexical for the other/object performing direct self-reference. In this case, we can substitute "He" with another name equivalently, such as "Shakespeare." Such a substitution is trivial; "Shakespeare" fully inherits the meaning of "He," thereby allowing "He" to undergo an operation that strips it of specific meaning, making "He" a tool available for recursive use.

Shifting the perspective: in the activity of linguistic practice—that is, for me, who has already entered the process of the language system—I have always already been called something by others. Among these descriptions and appellations, I may accept or reject a series of descriptions regarding myself. The right to choose between acceptance and rejection implies the contingency of these descriptions; hence, these descriptions cannot necessarily refer to me. However, the one thing I am compelled to accept, the one thing I must accept, is that I have offered my self-identity as the identity of an object in the eyes of the Other, and the word "He" is used to refer to this object-identity. Since this word refers precisely to my identity, I must necessarily acknowledge that the "He" spoken by the Other refers to me myself. Furthermore, it is also something I must accept that "Shakespeare," the successor to "He," refers to me. For I must admit that the Other always refers solely to my self-identity using some indexical, and this indexical happens to be "Shakespeare" in appearance and "shashibiya" in pronunciation. The appearance and pronunciation are unimportant; what is important is that this indexical constitutes my necessary name. From then on, Shakespeare could not have been other than Shakespeare, just as I could not have been other than I.

In the process by which such a causal chain of names is transmitted, the core key lies not in how the speaker names the object, but in how the object offers its own identity to the speaker. Benefiting from the absolute necessity of self-reference, the indexical brought forth by the word "I" and its causal sequence enable the proper name to necessarily pick out (rigidly designate) this specific object of "me." This process, which endows me with a name, is full of cooperation and mutual dependence: I provide the "I" that signifies identity, and I provide the "He" that signifies alterity. And because total alterity also implies the total identity of another individual, "He" is recognized by the object itself as a designator for itself—because although "He" is uttered by the Other, it proclaims its own identity within itself. The "Name" that inherits "He" is viewed by the object itself as an equivalent to "I," and by the object's Other as a necessary reference to the object itself. Thus, the name acquires the necessity of reference through He and I.
