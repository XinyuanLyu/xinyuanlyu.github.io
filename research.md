# Research & Projects

## Economics
- **Health and Cognitive Consequences of Widowhood in Middle-aged and Elderly in China**  
  *Abstract:* This research utilizes China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data
employing event study methodology to investigate the effects of widowhood on mortality
risk, health, and cognitive function among middle-aged and elderly individuals in China. I
did not find significant effects of widowhood on mortality risk. However, my results
indicate a minor impact on physical health, primarily reflected in an increased probability of
chronic diseases. Notably, there is a significant rise in the risk of depression and cognitive
impairment, adversely affecting Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) capabilities
and life expectancy. Further, I observe considerable heterogeneity in the negative effects of
widowhood across different genders, urban-rural categories, and city sizes. However, no
significant differences were found across varying levels of education and the number of
children, suggesting that children cannot substitute the role of a spouse in post-widowhood
life. The mechanism analysis reveals that individuals try to mitigate the negative impacts of
widowhood by significantly increasing social activities, leisure, and the use of more
medical resources. Additionally, remarriage in middle and old age might offset the adverse
effects of widowhood.
