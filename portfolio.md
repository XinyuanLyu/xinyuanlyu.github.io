  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* This research utilizes China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data employing event study methodology to investigate the effects of widowhood on mortality risk, health, and cognitive function among middle-aged and elderly individuals in China. I did not find significant effects of widowhood on mortality risk. However, my results indicate a minor impact on physical health, primarily reflected in an increased probability of chronic diseases. Notably, there is a significant rise in the risk of depression and cognitive impairment, adversely affecting Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) capabilities and life expectancy. Further, I observe considerable heterogeneity in the negative effects of widowhood across different genders, urban-rural categories, and city sizes. However, no significant differences were found across varying levels of education and the number of children, suggesting that children cannot substitute the role of a spouse in post-widowhood life. The mechanism analysis reveals that individuals try to mitigate the negative impacts of widowhood by significantly increasing social activities, leisure, and the use of more medical resources. Additionally, remarriage in middle and old age might offset the adverse effects of widowhood.</p>
