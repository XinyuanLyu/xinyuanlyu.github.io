# My Poem

I will share my poems here. A dedicated folder has been created for uploads at `assets/poems/`.

To add new works, place files (e.g., PDF, TXT, or images) into `assets/poems/`, then link them here. Example links (to be updated after uploads):

- [Title of Poem 1](/assets/poems/poem1.pdf)
- [Title of Poem 2](/assets/poems/poem2.pdf)

More works coming soon.
