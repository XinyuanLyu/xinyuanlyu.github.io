## Introduction
I am a cross-disciplinary thinker trained in Economics, Philosophy, and AI, currently pursuing my M.S. in Economics & Computation at Duke University. Before Duke, I completed dual B.A. degrees in Economics and Philosophy at Peking University.

My academic journey cuts across the humanities, sciences, engineering, business, and social sciences. My thinking is always directed toward totality and structure, and my aspiration is to contribute to paradigm-level innovations. Recently, I have been particularly interested in how deep learning and AI can expand the paradigms of economics and business research, enabling new ways to model decision-making, markets, and institutions.

Beyond research, I thrive in dynamic, social, and creative environments. I write poetry, play sports competitively, and draw inspiration from music, travel, and conversations. For me, inspiration often comes at the intersection of rigorous analysis and diverse human experience.

My long-term vision is to lead initiatives that integrate strategic thinking, data, and creativity—whether in academia, policy, or industry innovation.
