### The Priority of Self-Reference and the Necessity of Proper Names

一种原初的同一性乃是自我同一性，一种原初的直接指称乃是对象的自我指称。如果对象的同一性是被承认的，那么对象对于自己的指称确实是一种必然的非中介的直接指称，因为对象本身与其名称的分裂乃是一种自我分裂，这一过程并不依赖于对象以外的东西。然而我的名称和我本身毕竟具有最原初意义上的差异，这种差异恰恰又否定了原初的自我同一性；但是这样一种差异又在自我指称的过程中被否定了，“我是我”这一原初的命名活动或者指称活动，无疑通过分裂的方式（我的名称和我的分裂）表达自我对于自身同一性的声明。这样一种表达是直接性的，而为了要达到这样一种直接的表达，自我不得不进行自我分裂。我这一指示词因此具有在先性地位。

然而我并不能够仅仅处于其绝对孤立性之中，自我总是超出自身，与非我也即他者打交道而不得不进入到差异的畿域，在这一畿域中，每一个位格上具有同等地位的个体对象都通过“我”给出对于自身同一性的声明，而每一份声明，在自己以外的其他个体那里恰恰天然地标识了差异性和异己性，并且标识出了异己的对象的自我同一性，那么对于个体而言，其他他者的诸“我”构成了原初的对于他者的命名，即我用他者·对象的“我”作为这一对象的专名。专名第一次从自我指称中分离出来。我们统称为他5。“他”对于对象的指称一定是必然的指称，因为“他”只不过是我这一无条件的自我指称的另一位格，因而也是必然的，他不依赖于任何描述或者性质，“他”源自于自我指称的必然性以及复数的自我指称带来的差异——我的自我指称是唯一的，而在其他对象的自我指称中我看到了那种直接性的命名活动和名称，这些具有直接指向对象本身效力的名称被我叫做“他”，也即，“他”就其完全的意义而言就是他者对象进行直接的自我指称的指示词。在这种情况下，我们可以用另一个名称等价替换“他”，比如说“莎士比亚”，这样一种替换是平凡的，“莎士比亚”完全继承了“他”的意义，从而“他”可以进行一种消除意义的操作，而使得“他”这一工具可以多次循环使用。

换一种视角，在语言实践活动中，也就是已经进入到语言体系的过程中的我，总已经被他者称作了什么了，而在这些描述和称谓中，我可以接受或者不接受对于我的一系列描述，可接受与不接受的选择权意味着这些描述的偶然性，因而这些描述根本不能必然地指称我。但是，唯一一点是我不得不接受的，是我必然要接受的，就是我给出了我的自身同一性作为他者看来的对象的同一性，而“他”这一词语被用来指称这种对象的同一性。而由于这一词语指称的恰恰就是我的同一性，因此我必然地承认他者口中的“他”指的就是我本身。进而，“他”的继承者“莎士比亚”指称着我也是我不得不接受的，因为我必须承认，他者总是以某个指示词仅仅指称着我的自我同一性，而这个指示词碰巧在外观上是“莎士比亚”，在发音上是“shashibiya”，外观和发音是不重要的，重要的是这一指示词构成了我的必然的名字。从此，莎士比亚不能够本不是莎士比亚，恰如，我不能够本不是我。

在这样一种名称的因果链条得以传递的过程当中，核心关键在于不是说话者如何命名对象，而是对象如何向说话者给出它自己的同一性。得益于自我指称的绝对必然性，通过“我”这一词语所带出的指示词及其因果序列从而使得专名得以必然性地切中我这一个对象。这一使得我具有名字的过程里边充满了合作和相互依赖：我给出表明同一性的“我”，我给出表明异己性的“他”，而因为完全异己性也意味着另一个体的完全同一性，因此“他”被对象的自我承认为对于自己的指示词，因为虽然“他”是被他者所道出的，但在他自己那里反而声名了自己的同一性。继承了“他”的“名字”在对象自己那里被视为了“我”的等价，在对象的他者那里又被视为对这个对象本身的必然指称。因此，名字经有他和我获得了指称的必然性。

A primordial identity is self-identity, and a primordial immediate reference is the object's self-reference. If the identity of an object is recognized, then the object's reference to itself is indeed a necessary, non-mediated, immediate reference. This is because the split between the object itself and its name is a self-division, a process that does not rely on anything outside the object. Although there is, after all, a primordial difference between my name and myself—a difference that precisely negates the primordial self-identity—this difference is negated once again in the process of self-reference. The primordial naming or referring activity of "I am I" undoubtedly expresses the self's declaration of its own identity through a mode of division (the division of my name from me). Such an expression is immediate, yet to achieve this immediate expression, the self is compelled to undergo self-division. The indexical "I," therefore, holds a status of priority.

However, I cannot remain merely in absolute isolation. The self always exceeds itself, dealing with the non-self—that is, the Other—and is thus compelled to enter the domain of difference. In this domain, every individual object, possessing equal status in personhood, issues a declaration of its own identity through "I." Yet, each declaration, when received by individuals other than oneself, naturally marks a difference and an alterity, while simultaneously marking the self-identity of that alien object. Thus, for an individual, the plural "I"s of others constitute the primordial naming of the Other; that is, I use the "I" of the other/object as the proper name for that object. The proper name is separated from self-reference for the first time. We collectively call this "He." "He" is a necessary reference to the object because "He" is merely another persona of this unconditional self-reference; thus, it is also necessary. It does not depend on any description or property. "He" originates from the necessity of self-reference and the difference brought about by plural self-references—my self-reference is unique, whereas in the self-references of other objects, I perceive that immediate naming activity and name. These names, which possess the efficacy of pointing directly to the object itself, are what I call "He." That is to say, "He," in its fullest sense, is the indexical for the other/object performing direct self-reference. In this case, we can substitute "He" with another name equivalently, such as "Shakespeare." Such a substitution is trivial; "Shakespeare" fully inherits the meaning of "He," thereby allowing "He" to undergo an operation that strips it of specific meaning, making "He" a tool available for recursive use.

Shifting the perspective: in the activity of linguistic practice—that is, for me, who has already entered the process of the language system—I have always already been called something by others. Among these descriptions and appellations, I may accept or reject a series of descriptions regarding myself. The right to choose between acceptance and rejection implies the contingency of these descriptions; hence, these descriptions cannot necessarily refer to me. However, the one thing I am compelled to accept, the one thing I must accept, is that I have offered my self-identity as the identity of an object in the eyes of the Other, and the word "He" is used to refer to this object-identity. Since this word refers precisely to my identity, I must necessarily acknowledge that the "He" spoken by the Other refers to me myself. Furthermore, it is also something I must accept that "Shakespeare," the successor to "He," refers to me. For I must admit that the Other always refers solely to my self-identity using some indexical, and this indexical happens to be "Shakespeare" in appearance and "shashibiya" in pronunciation. The appearance and pronunciation are unimportant; what is important is that this indexical constitutes my necessary name. From then on, Shakespeare could not have been other than Shakespeare, just as I could not have been other than I.

In the process by which such a causal chain of names is transmitted, the core key lies not in how the speaker names the object, but in how the object offers its own identity to the speaker. Benefiting from the absolute necessity of self-reference, the indexical brought forth by the word "I" and its causal sequence enable the proper name to necessarily pick out (rigidly designate) this specific object of "me." This process, which endows me with a name, is full of cooperation and mutual dependence: I provide the "I" that signifies identity, and I provide the "He" that signifies alterity. And because total alterity also implies the total identity of another individual, "He" is recognized by the object itself as a designator for itself—because although "He" is uttered by the Other, it proclaims its own identity within itself. The "Name" that inherits "He" is viewed by the object itself as an equivalent to "I," and by the object's Other as a necessary reference to the object itself. Thus, the name acquires the necessity of reference through He and I.
