# Personal Thoughts

This is a space for short essays, notes, and reflections. The following sections are placeholders to be expanded later.

# The Priority of Self-Reference and the Necessity of Proper Names

一种原初的同一性乃是自我同一性，一种原初的直接指称乃是对象的自我指称。如果对象的同一性是被承认的，那么对象对于自己的指称确实是一种必然的非中介的直接指称，因为对象本身与其名称的分裂乃是一种自我分裂，这一过程并不依赖于对象以外的东西。然而我的名称和我本身毕竟具有最原初意义上的差异，这种差异恰恰又否定了原初的自我同一性；但是这样一种差异又在自我指称的过程中被否定了，“我是我”这一原初的命名活动或者指称活动，无疑通过分裂的方式（我的名称和我的分裂）表达自我对于自身同一性的声明。这样一种表达是直接性的，而为了要达到这样一种直接的表达，自我不得不进行自我分裂。我这一指示词因此具有在先性地位。

然而我并不能够仅仅处于其绝对孤立性之中，自我总是超出自身，与非我也即他者打交道而不得不进入到差异的畿域，在这一畿域中，每一个位格上具有同等地位的个体对象都通过“我”给出对于自身同一性的声明，而每一份声明，在自己以外的其他个体那里恰恰天然地标识了差异性和异己性，并且标识出了异己的对象的自我同一性，那么对于个体而言，其他他者的诸“我”构成了原初的对于他者的命名，即我用他者·对象的“我”作为这一对象的专名。专名第一次从自我指称中分离出来。我们统称为他5。“他”对于对象的指称一定是必然的指称，因为“他”只不过是我这一无条件的自我指称的另一位格，因而也是必然的，他不依赖于任何描述或者性质，“他”源自于自我指称的必然性以及复数的自我指称带来的差异——我的自我指称是唯一的，而在其他对象的自我指称中我看到了那种直接性的命名活动和名称，这些具有直接指向对象本身效力的名称被我叫做“他”，也即，“他”就其完全的意义而言就是他者对象进行直接的自我指称的指示词。在这种情况下，我们可以用另一个名称等价替换“他”，比如说“莎士比亚”，这样一种替换是平凡的，“莎士比亚”完全继承了“他”的意义，从而“他”可以进行一种消除意义的操作，而使得“他”这一工具可以多次循环使用。

换一种视角，在语言实践活动中，也就是已经进入到语言体系的过程中的我，总已经被他者称作了什么了，而在这些描述和称谓中，我可以接受或者不接受对于我的一系列描述，可接受与不接受的选择权意味着这些描述的偶然性，因而这些描述根本不能必然地指称我。但是，唯一一点是我不得不接受的，是我必然要接受的，就是我给出了我的自身同一性作为他者看来的对象的同一性，而“他”这一词语被用来指称这种对象的同一性。而由于这一词语指称的恰恰就是我的同一性，因此我必然地承认他者口中的“他”指的就是我本身。进而，“他”的继承者“莎士比亚”指称着我也是我不得不接受的，因为我必须承认，他者总是以某个指示词仅仅指称着我的自我同一性，而这个指示词碰巧在外观上是“莎士比亚”，在发音上是“shashibiya”，外观和发音是不重要的，重要的是这一指示词构成了我的必然的名字。从此，莎士比亚不能够本不是莎士比亚，恰如，我不能够本不是我。

在这样一种名称的因果链条得以传递的过程当中，核心关键在于不是说话者如何命名对象，而是对象如何向说话者给出它自己的同一性。得益于自我指称的绝对必然性，通过“我”这一词语所带出的指示词及其因果序列从而使得专名得以必然性地切中我这一个对象。这一使得我具有名字的过程里边充满了合作和相互依赖：我给出表明同一性的“我”，我给出表明异己性的“他”，而因为完全异己性也意味着另一个体的完全同一性，因此“他”被对象的自我承认为对于自己的指示词，因为虽然“他”是被他者所道出的，但在他自己那里反而声名了自己的同一性。继承了“他”的“名字”在对象自己那里被视为了“我”的等价，在对象的他者那里又被视为对这个对象本身的必然指称。因此，名字经有他和我获得了指称的必然性。

A primordial identity is self-identity, and a primordial immediate reference is the object's self-reference. If the identity of an object is recognized, then the object's reference to itself is indeed a necessary, non-mediated, immediate reference. This is because the split between the object itself and its name is a self-division, a process that does not rely on anything outside the object. Although there is, after all, a primordial difference between my name and myself—a difference that precisely negates the primordial self-identity—this difference is negated once again in the process of self-reference. The primordial naming or referring activity of "I am I" undoubtedly expresses the self's declaration of its own identity through a mode of division (the division of my name from me). Such an expression is immediate, yet to achieve this immediate expression, the self is compelled to undergo self-division. The indexical "I," therefore, holds a status of priority.

However, I cannot remain merely in absolute isolation. The self always exceeds itself, dealing with the non-self—that is, the Other—and is thus compelled to enter the domain of difference. In this domain, every individual object, possessing equal status in personhood, issues a declaration of its own identity through "I." Yet, each declaration, when received by individuals other than oneself, naturally marks a difference and an alterity, while simultaneously marking the self-identity of that alien object. Thus, for an individual, the plural "I"s of others constitute the primordial naming of the Other; that is, I use the "I" of the other/object as the proper name for that object. The proper name is separated from self-reference for the first time. We collectively call this "He." "He" is a necessary reference to the object because "He" is merely another persona of this unconditional self-reference; thus, it is also necessary. It does not depend on any description or property. "He" originates from the necessity of self-reference and the difference brought about by plural self-references—my self-reference is unique, whereas in the self-references of other objects, I perceive that immediate naming activity and name. These names, which possess the efficacy of pointing directly to the object itself, are what I call "He." That is to say, "He," in its fullest sense, is the indexical for the other/object performing direct self-reference. In this case, we can substitute "He" with another name equivalently, such as "Shakespeare." Such a substitution is trivial; "Shakespeare" fully inherits the meaning of "He," thereby allowing "He" to undergo an operation that strips it of specific meaning, making "He" a tool available for recursive use.

Shifting the perspective: in the activity of linguistic practice—that is, for me, who has already entered the process of the language system—I have always already been called something by others. Among these descriptions and appellations, I may accept or reject a series of descriptions regarding myself. The right to choose between acceptance and rejection implies the contingency of these descriptions; hence, these descriptions cannot necessarily refer to me. However, the one thing I am compelled to accept, the one thing I must accept, is that I have offered my self-identity as the identity of an object in the eyes of the Other, and the word "He" is used to refer to this object-identity. Since this word refers precisely to my identity, I must necessarily acknowledge that the "He" spoken by the Other refers to me myself. Furthermore, it is also something I must accept that "Shakespeare," the successor to "He," refers to me. For I must admit that the Other always refers solely to my self-identity using some indexical, and this indexical happens to be "Shakespeare" in appearance and "shashibiya" in pronunciation. The appearance and pronunciation are unimportant; what is important is that this indexical constitutes my necessary name. From then on, Shakespeare could not have been other than Shakespeare, just as I could not have been other than I.

In the process by which such a causal chain of names is transmitted, the core key lies not in how the speaker names the object, but in how the object offers its own identity to the speaker. Benefiting from the absolute necessity of self-reference, the indexical brought forth by the word "I" and its causal sequence enable the proper name to necessarily pick out (rigidly designate) this specific object of "me." This process, which endows me with a name, is full of cooperation and mutual dependence: I provide the "I" that signifies identity, and I provide the "He" that signifies alterity. And because total alterity also implies the total identity of another individual, "He" is recognized by the object itself as a designator for itself—because although "He" is uttered by the Other, it proclaims its own identity within itself. The "Name" that inherits "He" is viewed by the object itself as an equivalent to "I," and by the object's Other as a necessary reference to the object itself. Thus, the name acquires the necessity of reference through He and I.

## 综述与宗旨
## Overview and Purpose

凡我所见的，都在我是伟大的。凡于我的，我是伟大的。凡大地上生的，莫不是呈现出伟大的。凡在我是纯真的，也即是馥郁的，且是可爱的，莫不是神的。凡在这是馥郁的，也是我所真诚喜悦的。[^1]
> All that I see is great within Me. All that is of Me, I am great. All that is born on the earth, manifests greatness. All that is innocent within Me, is fragrant, and is lovely, and is of God. All that is fragrant here, is also what I sincerely delight in. [^1]

然而我的朋友，是的，你处于极大的迷惘之中，处于极大的悲痛之中，是的，你处在漂泊之中，你的心在命运的不安之中。[^2]
> Yet my friend, yes, you are in great confusion, in great sorrow. Yes, you are wandering, and your heart is in the unrest of destiny. [^2]

然而一切不愿承认的，必先面对自己。[^3] 一切至诚的人处在这样的悲痛中。[^4]
> However, all who are unwilling to admit must first face themselves. [^3] All sincere people dwell in such sorrow. [^4]

你睁开眼看看罢，只要你想看也就可以看到。你实在还没得着生命。[^5] 为此，一切价值不在话语中，而在光里，不在思维之中，而在生命里。[^6]
> Open your eyes and look; as long as you wish to see, you can see. You have not truly obtained life yet. [^5] Therefore, all value lies not in words, but in the Light; not in thinking, but in Life. [^6]

一切儿女们，众命运里的不安者，众兄弟姐妹们，我实在地告诉你们，倘若在虚无里，你得不到生命，倘若在欺妄里，你更得不到光。徘徊不定的众时代，终究要再建立，终究会有新的历史，有新的生命。[^7]
> All children, all restless ones in destiny, all brothers and sisters, I tell you truly: if you are in the void, you cannot obtain life; if you are in deception, you can obtain light even less. The wandering ages shall eventually be re-established; there shall eventually be a new history and a new life. [^7]

## 第一次回应
## The First Response

你难道不是固守着你所领受的天命吗？你的原则和使命。[^8]
> Are you not clinging fast to the mandate you have received? Your principles and your mission. [^8]

你们确实是领受使命的，何不是我曾经将教会建立在磐石上，从而把天国的钥匙赐予你们。然而我实在地告诉你，你们不是用天国的钥匙打开天国的门，而是用钥匙作为十字架。[^9]
> Indeed, you have received a mission. Did I not once build the church upon a rock and give you the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven? Yet I tell you truly, you do not use the keys of the Kingdom to open the gates of Heaven, but rather, you use the keys *as* a cross. [^9]

有耳的当听！你们的原则里是疲惫者的沮丧，然而谁要是疲惫于眼前的，谁就不配做我的门徒。[^10] 你们不是听说过吗？天国的福是大的。然而倘若疲惫于你所行的，哪里又看见天国的光呢？[^11]
> He who has ears, let him hear! Within your principles lies the depression of the weary. Yet whoever is weary of what is before him is not worthy to be my disciple. [^10] Have you not heard? Great are the blessings of the Kingdom. But if you are weary of what you do, where will you see the light of the Kingdom? [^11]

## 论三种诱惑
## On the Three Temptations

### 论第一种诱惑
### On the First Temptation

撒旦退去吧。[^12] 比起人间的食粮，天国的供养是大的。比起人间的食物，只要我给他们以真理，他们难道不会跟随我吗？[^13]
> Satan, be gone! [^12] Compared to earthly bread, the provision of the Kingdom is greater. Compared to earthly food, if I but give them Truth, will they not follow me? [^13]

野兽和巨龙，倘若他们能给你食粮，你们便跟随他罢。然而他们不是富有而是匮乏，不是完满而是缺陷。[^14]
> The beasts and the dragon—if they can give you bread, then follow them. Yet they are not wealth but lack; not fullness but defect. [^14]

我实在地告诉你，当那日子来临时，贫苦的和孩子反而要上天堂，那富人进天堂比骆驼穿过针眼还要难！[^15]
> I tell you truly, when that day comes, the poor and the children shall enter Heaven instead, while it is harder for a rich man to enter Heaven than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle! [^15]

谛听！人岂不是要永生吗？唯有在永生里才得着喜悦安宁。[^16] 而我就是要把生命给你们。[^17]
> Listen! Does man not desire eternal life? Only in eternal life can one find joy and peace. [^16] And I am here to give you Life. [^17]

凡谦逊者有福了。[^18] 庸人在荒谬中实施无止境的自欺，且是多傲慢的。他们不懂得谦逊和真诚。既与神背离，又不敢拥抱生命，于是成为懦夫和亵渎者，还自以为伟大。[^19]
> Blessed are the humble. [^18] Mediocre men practice endless self-deception in absurdity, and how arrogant they are. They understand neither humility nor sincerity. Turning away from God, yet daring not to embrace Life, they become cowards and blasphemers, yet esteem themselves great. [^19]

为此，你们不要有丝毫欺骗，也不要自欺。[^20]
> Therefore, do not practice the slightest deceit, and do not deceive yourselves. [^20]

然而我的朋友，你若理解我，又怎么会厌弃我的权柄？[^21] 这权柄由我天上的父赐予我，又由我赐予众人。[^22]
> Yet my friend, if you understood me, how could you despise my authority? [^21] This authority was given to me by my Father in heaven, and is given by me to all. [^22]

你不要害怕这权柄，因为亵渎者从来不因这权柄而亵渎，而他们早在示拿的平原就思想着僭越的事。[^23] 除了依靠这权柄，藉着我的肉和血，没有人能够得救。[^24]
> Do not fear this authority, for blasphemers never blaspheme because of this authority; rather, long ago on the plain of Shinar, they plotted usurpation. [^23] Except by relying on this authority, and through my flesh and blood, no one can be saved. [^24]

## 必要实现的预言
## The Prophecy That Must Be Fulfilled

拒绝救赎，因为不能允许哪怕任何一个人为了救赎而牺牲，哪怕一个孩子作为未来的垫脚石而被抛弃。[^25] 那些罪人因为他们软弱而牺牲吗，而一切人莫不是软弱的？[^26]
> You refuse redemption, because you cannot allow even a single person to be sacrificed for the sake of redemption, nor even a single child to be cast aside as a stepping stone for the future. [^25] Do those sinners succumb because of their weakness? Yet, is not everyone weak? [^26]

然而我爱世人，使得一切信我的，都不至灭亡，反得永生。[^27] 除非天国建基于我，否则便没有道路。[^28]
> Yet I love the world, that whoever believes in me shall not perish but have eternal life. [^27] Unless the Kingdom is built upon Me, there is no Way. [^28]

我实在地对你说，那预言的总要实现，新天新地也总要建立。[^29] 那最终的日子里，历史不再有了，然而不是在蚂蚁窝中得到永远，乃是在伊甸园里得到永恒。[^30]
> I tell you truly, the prophecy shall be fulfilled, and the New Heaven and New Earth shall be established. [^29] In those final days, history shall be no more. Yet, eternity is not found in the ant-hill, but in Eden. [^30]

于是人们团结在神的圣殿里，也就是乐园里得到喜悦了。[^31]
> Thus, people shall be united in God’s temple, which is to find joy in Paradise. [^31]

### 论第二种诱惑
### On the Second Temptation

人爱奇迹，倘若没有赐福与奇迹，谁又会信仰上帝呢？[^32]
> Men love miracles. If there were no blessings and miracles, who would believe in God? [^32]

然而我实在告诉你，自我来牺牲又复活以后，奇迹便不再降临了，[^33] 为道路既已经修直，又哪里需要新的牧人呢？[^34]
> Yet I tell you truly, since I came, sacrificed, and resurrected, miracles no longer descend. [^33] For since the Way has been made straight, where is the need for new shepherds? [^34]

以后的世代天天都是恩泽的奇迹，这个奇迹就是拯救，这个奇迹就是你们自己。[^35] 从而神不再与你们远离了，我在你们中间与你们同在。[^36]
> The generations to come are daily miracles of grace. This miracle is Salvation; this miracle is *yourselves*. [^35] Thus, God is no longer far from you; I am among you and with you. [^36]

我将跌倒的人扶起，将生病的人痊愈，使迷茫的人走出，使软弱的人坚强。[^37] 然而人的软弱，却不是神的，而是多虚妄的，必要靠我的名和言驱散。[^38]
> I lift up the fallen, heal the sick, lead the lost out, and strengthen the weak. [^37] Yet human weakness is not of God; it is full of vanity, and must be dispelled by my Name and my Word. [^38]

那生命在我里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却永远胜不了光。[^39]
> In Me is Life, and the Life is the Light of men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has never overcome the Light. [^39]

### 论第三种诱惑
### On the Third Temptation

拜金牛犊的众人有祸了，那施设偶像的人自己背弃了上帝。[^40] 历史的终点，所有人的幸福却寻不到；历史沉默了，然而少数人将保守其整个谎言的秘密。[^41]
> Woe to the multitude who worship the golden calf; he who sets up idols has himself forsaken God. [^40] At the end of history, the happiness of all is nowhere to be found; history falls silent, while a few shall keep the secret of its entire lie. [^41]

然而我的朋友，你那神圣的谎言将保持多久呢？谎言之下，真理依然。[^42]
> Yet my friend, how long will your holy lie last? Beneath the lie, the Truth remains. [^42]

你难道不是疲惫的吗，不是痛苦的吗？[^43] 然而来罢，我的孩子，那日子到时，你们不是在痛苦里行虚假的事业，而是在喜悦中向你的邻人和世人宣告天国的福音。[^44]
> Are you not weary? Are you not in pain? [^43] But come, my child. When that day comes, you shall not practice false works in agony, but shall declare the Gospel of the Kingdom to your neighbors and the world in joy. [^44]

## 第一赞美歌
## The First Hymn of Praise
*(自此向上耶稣完成对于宗教大法官的第一次回应与反驳，于是舒缓节奏，开始第一赞美歌的传颂，赞美上帝的拯救之道和造物的和谐美妙。)*
*(Here Jesus completes his first response and rebuttal to the Grand Inquisitor, slowing the rhythm to begin the first hymn, praising God's way of salvation and the harmonious beauty of creation.)*

**(第一曲首节 / Canto I, Stanza I)**
神造人不是为苦难而造的，而是为喜悦而造的，凡荣耀那道的，莫不是有福的，为喜悦属于他们，且从原初是未分离的。[^45]
> God did not create man for suffering, but for joy. Blessed are all who glorify the Word, for joy belongs to them, and from the beginning, it was inseparable. [^45]

人不是由自己而推己及人，而是由怜悯别人而怜悯自己。[^46] 我所说的，没有一样是童贞者所不了解的，童贞者总是已经这样做了。[^47]
> Man does not extend himself to others from himself, but has mercy on himself by having mercy on others. [^46] Nothing I say is unknown to the Virgin, for the Virgin has always done so. [^47]

求索而本真者必曰谦逊，凡谦逊者有福了，为他喜悦于所喜悦的。[^48] 凡真诚者有福了，为他本与上帝没有分离开。[^49]
> He who seeks and is authentic must be called humble. Blessed are the humble, for they delight in what is delightful. [^48] Blessed are the sincere, for they have never been separated from God. [^49]

凡喜悦者有福了，为上帝本令一切众生喜悦，普天莫不是喜悦的。[^50] 且这喜悦本是伊甸园生的，本是由道生的，且是由真诚说出的。[^51]
> Blessed are the joyful, for God intended all living beings to rejoice; there is nothing under heaven that is not joyful. [^50] And this joy is born of Eden, born of the Word, and spoken in sincerity. [^51]

**(第一曲次节 / Canto I, Stanza II)**
这确乎是真实的。那大道运行不止，神的灵运行不止，在那道是没有恶的，一切都是善的，凡在天国的，莫不是呈现出永恒的。[^52]
> This is indeed true. The Great Dao (The Word) moves unceasingly; the Spirit of God moves unceasingly. In the Word there is no evil; all is good. Everything in the Kingdom manifests the Eternal. [^52]

而恶人行恶事，却以着光辉崇高者行事。[^53] 这恶行不是由道生的，为那恶本不真实，且是虚假的，终究要被战胜的。[^54]
> Yet wicked men do wicked deeds, acting in the name of the radiant and the sublime. [^53] These wicked deeds are not born of the Word, for evil is not real; it is false, and shall ultimately be conquered. [^54]

凡怀有信心的，都是称为义的，为他本身向真理而生，且是相信那道路的。[^55]
> All who have faith are called righteous, for they are born towards the Truth and believe in the Way. [^55]

**(第一曲末节 / Canto I, Stanza III)**
这确乎是真实的，一切自始已在了上帝中，凡所在的，莫不在天国。[^56] 由此，一切众生莫不是在道的光下的，这光在原初照亮，凡所照的，莫不是在光辉荣耀下的。[^57]
> This is indeed true. Everything has been in God from the beginning; all that exists is in the Kingdom. [^56] Thus, all living beings are under the light of the Word. This Light shone in the beginning, and all that it illuminates is under radiant glory. [^57]

妄者是称为苦的，且必多疑惑，为这妄者在言语中双脚离了地，且在言语中多行恶事，这事在他是称为不义的，而单脚站立者并无至罪。[^58]
> The deluded are called bitter, and must be full of doubts; for the deluded have lifted both feet from the ground in their speech, and do many evil deeds in their speech. This is called unrighteousness in them, whereas he who stands on one foot is not in absolute sin. [^58]

**(第二曲首节 / Canto II, Stanza I)**
凡大地上生的有福了，为一切生命运行在大地上，确实不可分离。[^59] 凡有道的喜悦于道，无论何道，都以喜悦为乐，你们不要骄横执着，因而凡在我是喜悦的，莫不是呈现出伟大的，凡真诚者皆有福了。[^60]
> Blessed are those born on the earth, for all life moves upon the earth and is indeed inseparable. [^59] All who possess the Word delight in the Word; whatever the path, they take joy in delight. Do not be arrogant or attached. Therefore, all that is joyful in Me manifests greatness. Blessed are the sincere. [^60]

停下罢，这眼前并没有什么重负，一切莫不是呈现出自由而喜悦的。[^61] 为一切沉重都已过去（终极），而喜悦者依旧有所喜悦。[^62]
> Stop now. There is no heavy burden before your eyes; everything manifests as free and joyful. [^61] For all heaviness has passed (ultimately), and the joyful still possess their joy. [^62]

**(第二曲次节 / Canto II, Stanza II)**
我实在地告诉你们，不要无所适从，不要惊慌失措，不要惧畏所见的，也不要迷茫于道之外的。[^63] 不要行着歪道而惶恐不安，为那外道本虚幻且是造作的。[^64]
> I tell you truly: do not be at a loss, do not be panic-stricken. Do not fear what you see, and do not be confused by what lies outside the Way. [^63] Do not walk in crooked ways in trepidation, for the crooked way is illusory and artificial. [^64]

天国的秘密早已在我们中，确是真实的，确是至深的，一切喜悦者在天国中喜悦，为那外道中本无喜悦，且是多自欺的，自欺者但凡至于真诚的有福了，而虚妄的必站不住脚。[^65]
> The secret of the Kingdom is already among us. It is true, it is profound. All who rejoice, rejoice in the Kingdom, for there is no joy in the crooked way, only much self-deception. Blessed are the self-deceived who arrive at sincerity, but the vain shall not stand. [^65]

**(第二曲末节 / Canto II, Stanza III)**
那幸福确实是可得到的，且为容易得着。[^66] 然而喜悦却不显露，为那喜悦本在最深的苦难里，这苦难真实不虚，且是你我的通行证，为这众生藉着苦难而成，凡所成者，莫不是受于苦难的，也就因此得受于喜悦。[^67]
> Happiness is indeed attainable, and easily obtained. [^66] Yet joy is not revealed, for that joy lies in the deepest suffering. This suffering is real and not false; it is the passport for you and me. For all beings are perfected through suffering; all who are perfected have received suffering, and thus receive joy. [^67]

我实在地告诉你，那众生命的主，如今却隐晦不见。[^68] 不要在旁路上踯躅徘徊，而要往那路的笔直处寻求。[^69] 这向来如此的在原初并非一样。[^70]
> I tell you truly, the Lord of all life is now hidden and unseen. [^68] Do not loiter on the byways, but seek where the path is straight. [^69] What has always been so was not the same in the beginning. [^70]

唯有当我们寻找那真真正正永恒的时，在我神圣的光辉与崇高的美丽里，这最后之人才可以在生命元始的会和中达到永生，如是复活者在祂的光辉崇高里复活。[^71]
> Only when we seek that which is truly eternal, in My holy radiance and sublime beauty, can this Last Man attain eternal life in the primordial convergence of life. Thus the Resurrected One rises in His radiance and sublimity. [^71]

## 第二次回应
## The Second Response
*(耶稣在第一赞美歌中达到其真理的传颂，转而再次回应大法官。)*
*(Jesus reaches the praise of his truth in the first hymn, then turns to respond to the Grand Inquisitor once again.)*

我亲爱的的朋友啊，我的功绩是不需要承载的，进而无需纠正。[^72] 而你难道没有听说过吗，我来不是为了审判，而是为了救赎。[^73]
> My dear friend, my merit does not need to be borne, and thus needs no correction. [^72] And have you not heard? I came not to judge, but to save. [^73]

确实，你爱人类胜过一切。[^74] 爱人胜过爱人的意义，唯有如此你才能看见天国，爱生活胜过爱生活的意义，唯有如此你才能接近神性。[^75] 倘若你仅仅爱天国，天国又怎能向你展现呢？[^76]
> Indeed, you love humanity above all else. [^74] Love man more than the meaning of man; only thus can you see the Kingdom. Love life more than the meaning of life; only thus can you approach Divinity. [^75] If you only love the Kingdom, how can the Kingdom reveal itself to you? [^76]

为了理解我，你不得不变得和我一样，而这也即拯救之道。[^77] 然而为何你们要抛弃一切而甘愿负罪地去理解我呢？因为除去罪里本来就有你们对神的爱。[^78]
> To understand me, you must become like me, and this is the Way of Salvation. [^77] Yet why do you cast aside everything and willingly bear sin to understand me? Because within the removal of sin, there is already your love for God. [^78]

倘若不是爱祂，谁又会追寻我的脚步与我同担十字架呢？[^79] 我来是给你们指明这道路的。[^80] 你们是地上的盐，倘若失了味，又怎能叫他再咸呢？[^81]
> If one did not love Him, who would follow my footsteps and bear the cross with me? [^79] I came to show you this Way. [^80] You are the salt of the earth; if the salt has lost its savor, how shall it be salted again? [^81]

你们看见过那些罪人，然而我实在的告诉你，人若不如此犯罪就不能进我的国度，在灵中空虚的人有福了，你若不实在地抛弃你的义，又怎能承接我的赠予呢？[^82]
> You have seen those sinners, yet I tell you truly, if a man does not sin thus, he cannot enter my Kingdom. Blessed are the poor in spirit. If you do not truly cast aside your self-righteousness, how can you receive my gift? [^82]

我曾说过，爱你的上帝和你的邻人，确实，唯有爱你的上帝才有拯救，然而倘若没有邻人之爱，又如何去爱你的上帝呢？[^83]
> I have said: Love your God and your neighbor. Indeed, only in loving your God is there salvation; yet without the love of the neighbor, how can you love your God? [^83]

人若不被上帝拯救，就永远不能自己得救，我岂不是告诉你，罪的世代已经过去了，现在是恩典的世代。[^84]
> If man is not saved by God, he can never save himself. Did I not tell you? The generation of sin has passed; now is the generation of Grace. [^84]

你所言说的罪人，不是他们不能得救，而是他们尚未得救，然而凡得救的，莫不是已经在乐园里了，谁也从那名册上划不去他们的名。[^85]
> The sinners you speak of—it is not that they cannot be saved, but that they are not yet saved. Yet all who are saved are already in Paradise, and no one can strike their names from that Book. [^85]

所以你不必悲伤，我在吻里赐福于你。[^86] 你看看那绝对的自由罢，从而你看到你的渴望。[^87] 确实，你所拥有的，正是你所爱的，从而你的生命里有光，有价值，有安乐。[^88]
> Therefore, you need not sorrow; I bless you with a kiss. [^86] Look at that absolute freedom, and thereby see your longing. [^87] Indeed, what you possess is exactly what you love; thus in your life there is Light, Value, and Peace. [^88]

## 第二赞美歌：终曲
## The Second Hymn: Finale [^89]

**(第一终曲首节 / Finale I, Stanza I)**
我所要成就的，所施予的，所完成的救度，恰是要为得一切给予清白，乃是站在这里为一切施洗，将一切真诚的且芬芳的摆在面前。[^90]
> The salvation I am to achieve, to bestow, to complete, is precisely to grant innocence to all, to stand here and baptize all, setting all that is sincere and fragrant before you. [^90]

来罢，我的爱人——我所喜悦的。[^91] 这祝福实在地在你里头，于是你实在地有福了，为我的权柄与你同在。[^92]
> Come, my beloved—in whom I delight. [^91] This blessing is truly within you, and so you are truly blessed, for my authority is with you. [^92]

**(第一终曲次节 / Finale I, Stanza II)**
谛听！我必拭去你的泪水，为你们在我的怀抱里哭泣，甘于同我一齐负重，然而我必夺去你的负担，并一切真的喜悦馥郁连着我的爱毫无保留的赠予你。[^93]
> Listen! I will wipe away your tears, for you weep in my embrace, willing to bear the burden with me. Yet I will take away your burden, and unreservedly grant you all true joy and fragrance, together with my love. [^93]

你尽管将畏惧抛弃罢，为你的生命已经战胜了无孔不入的黑暗。[^94] 你不要畏惧，不要忧愁，而要喜悦，而要歌唱，你已经在天国，而我必将一切至于喜乐的赐给你，让你在花香中得着生命。[^95]
> Cast aside your fear, for your life has already conquered the all-pervading darkness. [^94] Do not fear, do not sorrow, but rejoice, and sing! You are already in the Kingdom, and I will give you everything that pertains to joy, letting you find Life amidst the fragrance of flowers. [^95]

**(第二终曲首节 / Finale II, Stanza I)** [^96]
别再颤抖畏缩，准备自己，准备去生活！[^97] 相信吧，是的，你拥有的，正是你所爱的，正是你为之斗争的。[^98]
> Tremble and shrink no more; prepare yourself, prepare to live! [^97] Believe, yes, what you possess is what you love, what you have fought for. [^98]

相信吧：你的降生并非无所谓，生活和苦难也绝非枉然。[^99] 那获得新生的，必将死去；而那死去的，必将复活！[^100]
> Believe: you were not born in vain; life and suffering are by no means in vain. [^99] What is born anew must die; and what dies shall rise again! [^100]

**(第二终曲次节 / Finale II, Stanza II)**
无孔不入的苦痛，我们已摆脱你的魔掌；无坚不摧的死亡，如今你已被征服！[^101] 乘着以炽热之爱的动力赢得的双翼，你将展翅飞翔！[^102]
> O Pain, thou all-pervading one, from thee have we escaped! O Death, thou all-conquering one, now art thou conquered! [^101] With wings won by the momentum of burning love, thou shalt fly! [^102]

你将死亡，直至再生！[^103] 是的！就在一瞬间，你奋力以求的一切，将领你得见上帝！[^104]
> Thou shalt die, only to live again! [^103] Yes! In an instant, all that thou hast striven for shall lead thee to see God! [^104]

### 注释 / Footnotes

[^1]: 上帝的造物本来是善的，并且是多希望的。从这里我们先揭示出真理中的样态，沐浴在真理中，莫不是赞叹于伟大和芬芳。
    > God's creation is inherently good and full of hope. Here we first reveal the modality within Truth: bathing in Truth, one cannot help but marvel at greatness and fragrance.

[^2]: 由此就指明宗教大法官没有在真理中，因为在真理中，就是在内在的精神天堂里，也就在之前所言的喜悦里，不是忧郁的，悲痛的和迷惘的。而是安宁的平和的和怀着幸福的。
    > This indicates that the Grand Inquisitor is not in the Truth. For to be in the Truth is to be in the inner spiritual heaven, and thus in the joy mentioned before—not melancholy, sorrowful, or confused, but tranquil, peaceful, and bearing happiness.

[^3]: 面对自己就是面对自己最深的原罪和由此最深的良知，我们难道要肯定宗教大法官已经获得了良知而跳在外头审视这一切吗？断乎不是。唯有如此，宗教大法官的行为才是解释的通的，我们才需要回应他，即宗教大法官实际上是一种误解，一种试图用谎言遮蔽真理，他自己面对自己的良知了吗？我们认为他实际上是误解了自己的良知与得救之道。
    > To face oneself is to face one's deepest original sin and thereby one's deepest conscience. Are we to affirm that the Grand Inquisitor has already attained conscience and stands outside scrutinizing all this? Certainly not. Only in this way is the Inquisitor's behavior explicable, and only thus do we need to respond to him: the Inquisitor is actually a misunderstanding, an attempt to cover the Truth with a lie. Has he faced his own conscience? We believe he has actually misunderstood his own conscience and the way of salvation.

[^4]: 但是我们不否认宗教大法官的真诚，这点后面将再提到。
    > However, we do not deny the sincerity of the Grand Inquisitor, which will be mentioned again later.

[^5]: 真理就是那道，就是人的光，也就是人的真生命。然而藉着耶稣，人们得到生命是容易的。是有指望的。
    > Truth is the Word (Logos), the Light of men, and thus the true Life of men. Yet through Jesus, it is easy for people to obtain life. There is hope.

[^6]: 发现良知和皈依良知是实践的，“活”出来的。
    > Discovering conscience and converting to conscience is practical; it is "lived" out.

[^7]: 直言否定宗教大法官关于人类命运前途的构想，而是指明人类前途的希望，如同启示录，“他胜了又要胜。”
    > Directly negating the Grand Inquisitor's conception of the future of human destiny, and instead pointing out the hope of human future, as in Revelation: "He went forth conquering, and to conquer."

[^8]: 这个原则和使命就是宗教大法官和他的教会所自觉领受的“天命”，就是崇拜权威的原则。也是拒绝自由的原则。
    > This principle and mission are the "Mandate of Heaven" consciously received by the Grand Inquisitor and his church; it is the principle of worshipping authority. It is also the principle of rejecting freedom.

[^9]: 讲的就是耶稣的话语和事迹都是通往天国的方法和钥匙，也就是阶而上者最终抛弃其形式的，而不是像教会一样将它们变为十字架----一个崇拜的符号。
    > This means that Jesus' words and deeds are the methods and keys to the Kingdom of Heaven—that is, the ladder which is ultimately discarded by the one who ascends—rather than turning them into a cross, a symbol of worship, as the church does.

[^10]: 宗教大法官是疲惫于了人的自由，因而厌弃了人的自由，他们疲惫于眼前的无休止的苦难，而丧失了信心，从而原则就是苦难的普遍化和不可避免性。
    > The Grand Inquisitor is weary of human freedom and thus abandons it. They are weary of the endless suffering before their eyes and have lost faith; thus, their principle is the generalization and inevitability of suffering.

[^11]: 天国的光就是人在天国的幸福，然而沉溺于痛苦和逃避痛苦的人世间永恒法则的人看不见天国的光明。
    > The light of the Kingdom is man's happiness in the Kingdom. However, those who indulge in suffering and the eternal earthly law of escaping suffering cannot see the light of the Kingdom.

[^12]: 马太福音 4：10
    > Matthew 4:10.

[^13]: 指的是耶稣拣选门徒时的情况，只需要说“跟随我”，门徒就会跟从耶稣。因为人本身爱真理胜过爱一切。
    > Referring to the situation when Jesus chose his disciples; he only needed to say "Follow me," and the disciples would follow him. Because man inherently loves Truth more than anything else.

[^14]: 指明那些妄图利用手段从物质上带给人永恒富足的不可能实现，他们本身缺乏灵，从而只能感受到精神的匮乏，不能满足人们对于不可遏制的精神世界的需要。
    > Pointing out the impossibility of those who vainly attempt to bring eternal abundance to people through material means. They lack spirit themselves, and thus can only feel spiritual lack, unable to satisfy people's irrepressible need for the spiritual world.

[^15]: 马太福音 19：24. 否认大法官的观点：人为了人间的食物反抗耶稣和他的道。因为富有的财主反而陷在物质里，看不见内心的天国之光，然而耶稣恰恰是代表一切贫苦的人的，他接触的多是穷人，病人，罪人，因而在逆境中的人反而会把耶稣的话当作希望和信念加以追求，进而皈依上帝。他们在自己的逆境中反而容易受到启示，坚定自己的信心。
    > Matthew 19:24. Denying the Inquisitor's view that men rebel against Jesus and His Word for earthly bread. For the rich are trapped in materialism and cannot see the inner light of the Kingdom. Jesus, however, represents all the poor; he touched mostly the poor, the sick, and sinners. Thus, those in adversity treat Jesus' words as hope and faith, pursuing them and converting to God. In their adversity, they are easily inspired to strengthen their faith.

[^16]: 人本性里就有对永生的追求和渴望，这个永生就是永恒的生命，不是靠别的能够达到的，而是在有限性的人认识到自己的有限性从而试图超越有限性，在与永恒真理接触时得到的。人一旦接触到这种真理，就得到了天国的生命，进而超越生灭流转，获得心灵的安宁平静。
    > Human nature inherently possesses a pursuit and longing for eternal life. This eternal life is not achieved by other means, but is obtained when finite man recognizes his finiteness and attempts to transcend it, coming into contact with eternal Truth. Once man touches this Truth, he obtains the life of the Kingdom, transcends the cycle of birth and death, and gains peace of mind.

[^17]: 耶稣和基督教的核心价值就是给人指明永生的意义和通往永生的道路。藉着耶稣，信徒得以救赎而永生。
    > The core value of Jesus and Christianity is to point out the meaning of eternal life and the way to it. Through Jesus, believers are redeemed and gain eternal life.

[^18]: 化用马太福音 5：3“虚心的人有福了，因为天国是他们的。”
    > Adapted from Matthew 5:3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

[^19]: 这里的庸人就是神化自己的人，以为人类世俗的痛苦和福祉是最大的，进而远离神的永恒性，他们只看见自己的痛苦，并尽其一切避苦趋福，却不知道他的苦和乐都是世俗的，进而是虚假的。他们极尽一切手段尝试建造巴别塔，以为自己是主宰，用“控制论”指导生命，却无非是渎神者。
    > "Mediocre men" here refers to those who deify themselves, thinking that human secular suffering and welfare are the greatest, thus distancing themselves from God's eternity. They only see their own suffering and do everything to avoid pain and seek pleasure, not knowing that their pain and joy are secular and thus false. They try every means to build the Tower of Babel, thinking they are masters, guiding life with "cybernetics," but they are nothing but blasphemers.

[^20]: 不自欺就是意味着承认自己的有限性，从而转向对于根本永恒真理的追求，也就是用真诚对待上帝和世界，也是直面自己的罪和苦。认识到苦是由罪虚假地施设的，从而是不属于永恒生命的。
    > Not deceiving oneself means admitting one's finiteness, thereby turning to the pursuit of fundamental eternal Truth. It means treating God and the world with sincerity, and facing one's own sin and suffering. It implies recognizing that suffering is falsely established by sin and thus does not belong to eternal life.

[^21]: 就是指赦免罪的权柄，得到救赎的可能性。
    > Refers to the authority to forgive sins, the possibility of obtaining redemption.

[^22]: 耶稣将精神的自由赐给人，也就是将在自由的获得良心而得救的希望和可能性赐给了人。
    > Jesus gave spiritual freedom to man, that is, he gave man the hope and possibility of obtaining conscience and being saved in freedom.

[^23]: 耶稣知道宗教大法官也认同那些反叛者渎神者最终也会自寻毁灭，但是大法官认为是耶稣赋予给人的自由导致这些反叛，而耶稣恰恰指出创世纪第 11 章的巴别塔而反驳，早就在他给人精神自由以前，人就想着僭越上帝了。因而不是耶稣的自由导致人反叛。那么意思就是让大法官不要害怕这种“自由”，因为这个自由恰恰是得救的可能性和赦免的权柄。
    > Jesus knows the Inquisitor agrees that rebels and blasphemers will eventually destroy themselves, but the Inquisitor thinks the freedom Jesus gave leads to this rebellion. Jesus refutes this by pointing to the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11: long before He gave man spiritual freedom, man thought of usurping God. Thus, it is not Jesus' freedom that causes rebellion. The meaning is to tell the Inquisitor not to fear this "freedom," for this freedom is precisely the possibility of salvation and the authority of forgiveness.

[^24]: 接上，我们只有藉着耶稣牺牲这个事件得到得救的道路，除此以外别无他法。
    > Continuing from above: we can only obtain the way of salvation through the event of Jesus' sacrifice; there is no other way.

[^25]: 这是宗教大法官的内在逻辑，不能为了十四万四千人而牺牲其他所有人。因而大法官指责耶稣不爱人类。
    > This is the internal logic of the Grand Inquisitor: one cannot sacrifice everyone else for the sake of the 144,000. Thus, the Inquisitor accuses Jesus of not loving humanity.

[^26]: 大法官认为人天性软弱，不能效仿耶稣，从而不可能得救。
    > The Inquisitor believes human nature is weak and cannot imitate Jesus, thus making salvation impossible.

[^27]: 耶稣直接点明上帝爱世人的根本，这样一切信他的都可以永生，而不会被抛弃。
    > Jesus directly points out the root of God's love for the world, so that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life and not be abandoned.

[^28]: 也就说明不是如宗教大法官所言，为了少数人牺牲大部分人，而是耶稣牺牲自己，从而铺平了道路，可以拯救所有人。只要相信得救之路，罪就赦免了，这里的核心乃是在于耶稣和宗教大法官历史观的分歧。
    > This explains that it is not, as the Inquisitor says, sacrificing the majority for the few. Rather, Jesus sacrificed Himself to pave the way to save *everyone*. As long as one believes in the way of salvation, sins are forgiven. The core here lies in the divergence between Jesus' and the Inquisitor's views of history.

[^29]: 这是指明了基督教的历史观，历史最终会指向绝对的目的和终点，整个人类历史是一个复归的历史，奥德赛式的永恒回归的历史，也是光明的最终建立新天新地的历史。我们可以想象，最终的“俄梅嘎”里，是普遍天国得到实现的光辉，天国落实在人的良心里，人恢复伊甸园时的神性。
    > This indicates the Christian view of history: history points to an absolute purpose and end. Human history is a history of return, an Odyssey-like eternal return, and a history of Light finally establishing a New Heaven and New Earth. We can imagine that in the final "Omega," there is the radiance of the universal Kingdom realized; the Kingdom is implemented in human conscience, and man restores the divinity of Eden.

[^30]: 这里反驳了大法官的历史观，宗教大法官认为最终他们凭借教会的权威，会建立一个将所有人统治为“幼儿”的国度，这里面所有人屈服于统一的秩序和原则，达到僵死的和谐。这种状态称为“永远”的平均化的庸俗世俗和谐体，也就是蚂蚁窝，所有蚂蚁抛弃自我而服从于蚁群整体，得到所谓的和谐。但是耶稣认为历史的终点是上一条提到的人的神性的普遍实现，因而是人对于有限性的超越，在自由里得到“永恒”的真理与生命。人们将会自由地达到积极的和谐状态。
    > This refutes the Inquisitor's view of history. The Inquisitor believes they will establish a kingdom ruling everyone as "infants" through church authority, where everyone submits to a unified order to achieve a dead harmony. This state is the "eternal" leveled, vulgar, secular harmony—the "ant-hill," where ants abandon the self to obey the colony for so-called harmony. But Jesus believes the end of history is the universal realization of human divinity mentioned above, a transcendence of finiteness, obtaining "eternal" Truth and Life in freedom. People will freely reach a state of positive harmony.

[^31]: 这种团结犹如席勒《欢乐颂》中的人们依靠自由博爱达到积极的神性的和谐状态，进而打破人与人相互分隔的状态，这种打破只能由积极的神性的发现而实现，不能由大法官消极的平庸化实现。
    > This unity is like Schiller's "Ode to Joy," where people rely on freedom and fraternity to reach a positive divine harmony, breaking the separation between people. This breaking can only be realized by the positive discovery of divinity, not by the Inquisitor's negative leveling.

[^32]: 旧约时代，人们依靠神迹与上帝进行沟通，依靠先知传递上帝的旨意。如果没有神迹，人们的信仰便无所指向，也就无所适从。
    > In the Old Testament era, people relied on miracles to communicate with God and on prophets to convey God's will. Without miracles, people's faith had no direction and they were at a loss.

[^33]: 新约时代以后，不再有奇迹了，我们再也看不到类似于摩西所行的伟大奇迹了。同时先知的降临也阻断了，耶稣以后再无先知（倘若我们不算伊斯兰先知）。那么我们就要思考新旧约时代的转变，这个转变预示着人神关系的根本转变。
    > After the New Testament era, there are no more miracles; we no longer see great miracles like Moses'. The coming of prophets also ceased; there are no prophets after Jesus (if we exclude Islamic prophets). We must reflect on the transition between the Old and New Testaments, which heralds a fundamental shift in the relationship between God and man.

[^34]: 化用自路加福音 3：4，“预备主的道，修直他的路。”施洗者约翰和之前一切先知一样，都是人类的“牧人”，他们沟通人和神。然而一切先知都是前救赎时代的预备和前兆，为的是救世主最后的降临。从而耶稣以后不再需要先知了，同理，基督第二次将领以后就不需要教会了。
    > Adapted from Luke 3:4, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight." John the Baptist and all prior prophets were "shepherds" of humanity, communicating between man and God. Yet all prophets were preparations and precursors of the pre-redemption era for the Savior's final coming. Thus, after Jesus, prophets are no longer needed; similarly, after the Second Coming, the church will no longer be needed.

[^35]: 自从耶稣指明救赎之道后，奇迹就不需要了，因为奇迹就在于人本身，在他的生活里，时时有得救的可能，能得救本身就是不可思议的奇迹，超越有限性就是世间最大的奇迹。
    > Since Jesus pointed out the way of redemption, miracles are no longer needed, because the miracle lies in man himself. In his life, there is always the possibility of salvation. To be saved is itself an incredible miracle; transcending finiteness is the greatest miracle in the world.

[^36]: 人神关系从旧约时代堕落以后人和神的分离和连结的破裂到恩典时代耶稣从新建立人和神的连结。从而人可以不需要先知而凭借自身的对于内在真理的发现而直接接触到神。神不再远离人，而是与每个人同在。
    > The God-man relationship shifted from the separation and rupture in the fallen Old Testament era to the re-establishment of the connection by Jesus in the Era of Grace. Thus, man can contact God directly through his own discovery of inner Truth without needing prophets. God is no longer far from man but is with everyone.

[^37]: 大法官视人的本性软弱，但是耶稣却要用真理使人坚强。
    > The Inquisitor views human nature as weak, but Jesus wants to make man strong through Truth.

[^38]: 耶稣进一步反对大法官将人的软弱视为绝对的。你可以把软弱视为普遍存在的，但不能把它视为绝对的。这也是大法官的根本谬误，将最不坚实的东西当作了最永恒不可变的。倘若连软弱这种生灭的最不可靠的都是坚实的，那么神的光和道岂不是更加坚实的吗？因而我们坚信，神的道是比软弱更加坚实的，这真理才是绝对的，进而终将驱散软弱。
    > Jesus further opposes the Inquisitor viewing human weakness as absolute. You can view weakness as ubiquitous, but not absolute. This is the Inquisitor's fundamental error: treating the least solid thing as the most eternal and immutable. If even weakness—unreliable and transient—is solid, is not God's Light and Word even more solid? Therefore, we firmly believe God's Word is more solid than weakness; this Truth is absolute and will eventually dispel weakness.

[^39]: 借用约翰福音 1：4-5，人的软弱和纠结和罪过是黑暗，但终究胜不了内心的良知之光。
    > Borrowing from John 1:4-5. Human weakness, entanglement, and sin are darkness, but they will ultimately not overcome the inner light of conscience.

[^40]: 直言大法官试图设立旧的新的或普遍的偶像崇拜的错误。因为向外崇拜偶像的人终究寻找不到内在的上 帝。于是偶像崇拜是神的物化，也就是“杀死上帝”，即拒绝上帝。
    > Directly pointing out the Inquisitor's error in trying to establish old, new, or universal idolatry. For those who worship outward idols will never find the inner God. Idolatry is the objectification of God, which is "killing God," i.e., rejecting God.

[^41]: 指的是大法官认为在世间建立权威的统治权的计划。耶稣预言即使他的计划能够实现，人在那种情况下也会失去幸福。这样历史被迫地终结与“沉默”，像大法官那样的少数人痛苦地欺骗所有人，并坚守秘密。
    > Refers to the Inquisitor's plan to establish authoritative rule on earth. Jesus predicts that even if this plan succeeds, people will lose happiness. History would be forced to end in "silence," with a minority like the Inquisitor painfully deceiving everyone and keeping the secret.

[^42]: 大法官的行为是某种谎言和秘密，那么就依然存在着不可消灭的真理。
    > The Inquisitor's behavior is a kind of lie and secret, implying that there still exists an indestructible Truth.

[^43]: 在大法官的设想下，天下最苦的人就是他们自己了，他们是为了人们的“幸福”，承担上最痛苦的谎言。
    > In the Inquisitor's conception, the most miserable people on earth are themselves. For the sake of people's "happiness," they bear the most painful lie.

[^44]: 作为耶稣的门徒他们的心灵基调不应该是苦大仇深，而是像佐西马和他哥哥一样，以平静和安乐作为基调的，耶稣也是以微笑面对一切的。
    > As Jesus' disciples, their spiritual tone should not be bitter and vengeful, but based on peace and joy, like Zosima and his brother. Jesus also faced everything with a smile.

[^45]: 这里透露神造物的奥秘，不是神要人苦难，而是神要人喜悦。而神人自始从根本就未分离，若是分离，又怎么会有拯救和尘世的真理和永恒的真理相遇呢？
    > This reveals the mystery of God's creation: God does not want man to suffer, but to rejoice. God and man have never been fundamentally separated from the beginning. If they were separated, how could there be salvation and the meeting of earthly truth with eternal Truth?

[^46]: 这就是奉献之道，也就是上帝之道，给出自身而终究获得自身。
    > This is the Way of Offering, the Way of God: giving oneself to ultimately gain oneself.

[^47]: 童贞者无原罪，纯洁无染，这也就是玛利亚和耶稣。他自己已经这样做了，进而为人树立榜样。
    > The Virgin has no original sin and is pure and unstained—this refers to Mary and Jesus. He Himself has done this, setting an example for man.

[^48]: 谦逊的人能够听见内心的神之道，从而本真地喜悦于自己的感悟。
    > Humble people can hear the inner Word of God, and thus authentically delight in their own realization.

[^49]: 真诚者本来就注定要与上帝同在，他们不离于道。
    > Sincere people are destined to be with God; they do not depart from the Word.

[^50]: 耶稣的福音就是“好消息”，就是喜悦。普天的造物本来应当共同沐浴在上帝的和谐中从而喜悦。
    > Jesus' Gospel is "Good News," which is joy. All creation under heaven should bathe together in God's harmony and rejoice.

[^51]: 伊甸园本来就是永恒的安乐地，喜悦是永恒真理，圣言由上帝的道产生，由耶稣真诚地说出。
    > Eden is inherently a place of eternal peace. Joy is eternal Truth. The Holy Word is produced by God's Dao/Word and spoken sincerely by Jesus.

[^52]: 同理人在神那里看到万物的美丽，如同佐西马顿悟时所见，然而人的罪也被照见但是同时看到人的罪之下的神性的美的本质。
    > Similarly, man sees the beauty of all things in God, as seen in Zosima's epiphany. Man's sin is illuminated, but at the same time, the essence of divine beauty beneath man's sin is seen.

[^53]: 假借神之名做恶事的人有祸了。他们是为了庸俗之目的的驱使着。然而请读者思考，宗教大法官属于这类人吗？私以为并不是。
    > Woe to those who do evil in God's name. They are driven by vulgar purposes. However, let the reader consider: does the Grand Inquisitor belong to this category? I personally think not.

[^54]: 在人中的原罪最后要被战胜，因为恶不是由上帝造的，是“存在的匮乏”，因而没有比它更虚假的。
    > Original sin in man must finally be defeated, because evil was not created by God; it is a "privation of being," and thus nothing is more false.

[^55]: 人因信称义，向着真理生活的人相信神的拯救之道。
    > Man is justified by faith; those who live towards Truth believe in God's way of salvation.

[^56]: 重复申明前面的真理。
    > Reaffirming the previous truth.

[^57]: 人的生命既然是光，就是属灵的，是荣耀神的，从而生命就是天堂。
    > Since man's life is Light, it is spiritual and glorifies God; thus, life is Heaven.

[^58]: 为什么单脚站立的人没有罪过？因为他们不反对神，还保留着与神的不可割裂的联系。
    > Why is the one standing on one foot without sin? Because they do not oppose God and still retain an inseparable connection with God.

[^59]: 大地上生的是上帝的造物与杰作。
    > What is born on earth is God's creation and masterpiece.

[^60]: 真诚有福的就是行耶稣所行的。
    > To be sincere and blessed is to do what Jesus did.

[^61]: 根本不需要大法官这种承担谎言的重负的。至于原罪，当你认识到它时，当你直面它时，犹如米哈伊尔，到底是沉重还是如释重负呢？认罪并遵循良知，从而不受良知的折磨，这难道不是最自由的和幸福的吗？
    > There is no need for the Inquisitor's burden of bearing lies. As for original sin, when you recognize it and face it, like Mikhail, is it heavy or a relief? To confess sin and follow conscience, thereby not being tortured by conscience—is this not the most free and happy state?

[^62]: 罪的世代过去了，从此是爱和恩典的世代。
    > The generation of sin has passed; henceforth it is the generation of Love and Grace.

[^63]: 不要迷茫于苦难和人生，要从苦难和流变中触及到那坚实的，见着良知时也不要害怕这个良知而要拥抱它。
    > Do not be confused by suffering and life. Touch the solid amidst suffering and flux. When seeing conscience, do not fear it, but embrace it.

[^64]: 歪道就是渎神和误解神意。
    > The crooked way is blasphemy and misunderstanding God's will.

[^65]: 至深的反而是至高的。喜悦者只有在天国里是真喜悦。那些追求其他的人，他们的喜悦转瞬如云烟，他们是自欺其人----妄图僭越者和自诩伟大者。但是自欺的人倘若怀着真诚的本愿，终究会走向良知的发现。
    > The deepest is the highest. The joyful are only truly joyful in the Kingdom. For those who pursue other things, their joy is fleeting like clouds. They are self-deceivers—presumptuous usurpers and self-proclaimed greats. But if self-deceivers harbor a sincere original wish, they will eventually move towards the discovery of conscience.

[^66]: 倘若旧约时代非得像约伯那样才能获得幸福，是再艰难不过的了，而在新约时代，只要人想要得到幸福，就能得到，因为耶稣为世人铺平了道路。“因为我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的。”（马太福音 11：30）
    > If in the Old Testament one had to be like Job to obtain happiness, it was incredibly difficult. But in the New Testament, as long as one wants happiness, one can obtain it, because Jesus paved the way for the world. "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light." (Matthew 11:30)

[^67]: 真理的喜悦在原罪生发的苦难深处，藉着受苦，人们容易得到启示，所以信徒应当称颂逆境。
    > The joy of Truth lies in the depths of suffering generated by original sin. Through suffering, people easily receive revelation, so believers should praise adversity.

[^68]: 生命的主被我们的虚妄的偏见的一切掩盖着，从而人要努力揭示出来。
    > The Lord of Life is covered by all our vain prejudices, so man must strive to reveal Him.

[^69]: 徘徊的人，应当坚定信心走向天堂。
    > Those who wander should firmly walk towards Heaven with faith.

[^70]: 不要忘记了原初神创造天地时的一切。
    > Do not forget everything when God originally created the heavens and the earth.

[^71]: 总结一切真理，当人寻找到原原本本的真理时，也就进入“神圣的光辉与崇高的美丽”，最后之人是得救之人，也是复活之人，复活不是别的，而是一种神圣的复归，在乐园-失乐园-复乐园的伟大历史进程，就是人复归于自己的生命和神性。
    > Summarizing all truth: when man finds the original Truth, he enters "Divine Radiance and Sublime Beauty." The Last Man is the Saved Man, and also the Resurrected Man. Resurrection is nothing but a divine return. The great historical process of Paradise-Lost Paradise-Regained Paradise is man returning to his own life and divinity.

[^72]: 回应大法官想要纠正耶稣的功绩，然而他不明白，耶稣的国不是罗马，也不是以色列，而是天国；不是要给人世俗的满足，而是生命的喜悦。
    > Responding to the Inquisitor's desire to correct Jesus' merit. He does not understand that Jesus' Kingdom is not Rome, nor Israel, but the Kingdom of Heaven; it is not to give secular satisfaction, but the joy of Life.

[^73]: 回应大法官“审判我吧，如果你能，你敢。”耶稣不是作为审判者降临，而是作为救世主。
    > Responding to the Inquisitor's "Judge me if you can, if you dare." Jesus did not come as a judge, but as a Savior.

[^74]: 宗教大法官怀着对人类最热烈的爱，对苦难最深刻的同情。这点是无需怀疑的。
    > The Grand Inquisitor harbors the most passionate love for humanity and the deepest sympathy for suffering. This is undoubted.

[^75]: 耶稣的道路也是要让人去爱，倘若不是对于人的爱，耶稣又怎么会将领，受难，牺牲呢？
    > Jesus' Way is also to let people love. If not for the love of man, how could Jesus descend, suffer, and sacrifice?

[^76]: 如果不是广泛的博爱，人在自私自利里也看不见天国，因而人要想得救，必要先给出自己。这点上，宗教大法官和耶稣的道路是一致的，他们都怀着对于人类的热爱和对人类命运的慈悲。
    > If not for broad universal love, man cannot see the Kingdom in selfishness. Thus, to be saved, man must first give himself. On this point, the Inquisitor's and Jesus' paths are consistent: they both harbor love for humanity and compassion for human destiny.

[^77]: 效仿耶稣就是理解他，从而得到救赎。
    > Imitating Jesus is understanding Him, and thus obtaining salvation.

[^78]: 人追寻耶稣的脚步是不可遏制的，对神的爱，对于有限性的超越是坚实的和本质的。
    > Man's pursuit of Jesus' footsteps is irrepressible. Love for God and the transcendence of finiteness are solid and essential.

[^79]: 为了这种爱，人甘愿为耶稣同担重负，不惜牺牲自己，十二门徒莫不是为耶稣殉道。大法官也是要担当拯救众人的重负，所以才表现出一种炽痛的热情，所以才表现出一种无法解释的高尚，从而他为了这个负担痛苦，迷茫，疲惫。
    > For this love, man is willing to bear the burden with Jesus, not sparing himself; the twelve disciples all martyred for Jesus. The Inquisitor also wants to bear the burden of saving everyone, showing a burning passion and an inexplicable nobility, suffering, confused, and weary for this burden.

[^80]: 和宗教大法官一样怀着济世热情的自古就不少，这些“赤子”怀着“爱人类”的最崇高理想。然而耶稣来是为这些怀着救世热情的赤子最终指明救赎的道路，即拯救之道。宗教大法官错就错在他没有真正理解耶稣的救赎之道，从而自己想出一条拉低全体人类的道路，而不是坚定地走耶稣之道。而他自己的道路终究不是真理，从而他迷茫痛苦怀疑。
    > There have been many since ancient times who harbor the same saving passion as the Grand Inquisitor, these "innocents" harboring the highest ideal of "loving humanity." However, Jesus came to finally point out the way of redemption to these innocents. The Inquisitor's error is that he did not truly understand Jesus' way of redemption, and thus devised a path that lowers all humanity, instead of firmly walking Jesus' Way. His own way is ultimately not Truth, hence his confusion, pain, and doubt.

[^81]: 如果这些热忱者不能坚持基督的道并宣扬福音，那么他们光怀有热情是不够的。（马太福音 5：13）
    > If these enthusiasts cannot adhere to Christ's Way and preach the Gospel, their passion alone is not enough. (Matthew 5:13)

[^82]: 大法官以为的罪人和软弱者实际上正是耶稣要拯救的人，耶稣不是治健康的人，而是治患病的。人是杯子，唯有清空自己的成见才能领受神的话语。因而虚心的人有福了。
    > The sinners and weaklings the Inquisitor thinks of are precisely those Jesus wants to save. Jesus does not heal the healthy, but the sick. Man is a cup; only by emptying his prejudices can he receive God's word. Thus, blessed are the humble.

[^83]: 人在对于他人的博爱中承受他人的罪，承认自己的罪，承担他人的罪，落实到实处就是爱邻人，宽恕伤害你的人。所以上帝之爱落实到邻人之爱的细节里。
    > In universal love for others, man bears others' sins, admits his own sins, and bears others' sins. This is implemented in loving the neighbor and forgiving those who hurt you. So God's love is implemented in the details of neighborly love.

[^84]: 上帝是仁慈和宽恕的，从而他要拯救他的子民，这个拯救靠的是人的良知，而不是靠人被玷污的人性。
    > God is merciful and forgiving, so He wants to save His people. This salvation relies on human conscience, not on man's tainted nature.

[^85]: 大法官以为多数人不能得救，从而就抛弃这道。然而他不知道，只是那些人尚未得救。佐西马长老的哥哥不是在他生命最后的日子里得救的吗？米哈伊尔不也是临死前获得清白的吗？而那些人一旦得救，就已经在乐园里了，他们的生命从此就充盈在爱和光里。这个名册是末日审判的名册，凡得救的必复活，复活者必永生。
    > The Inquisitor thinks the majority cannot be saved, so he abandons the Way. But he does not know that those people are simply *not yet* saved. Did not Elder Zosima's brother get saved in his final days? Did not Mikhail obtain innocence before death? Once saved, they are already in Paradise, and their lives are filled with Love and Light. This book is the book of the Last Judgment; all who are saved shall resurrect, and the resurrected shall have eternal life.

[^86]: 最终耶稣要消除大法官的迷茫而赐福于他。
    > Finally, Jesus wants to eliminate the Inquisitor's confusion and bless him.

[^87]: 人向内看到他的绝对自由时不应该害怕，因为那个自由是通往希望的自由，那个自由带来的不是混乱和灾难，而是和谐与希望。而一切混乱莫不是那个自由以外的东西压制自由导致的。在那个自由里，人会看到与上帝合一的渴望，也就是自觉走向真理的渴望。人的情感、理智、意志本来追求的就是喜悦、真理、自由。
    > When man looks inward at his absolute freedom, he should not fear, for that freedom is the freedom leading to hope, bringing not chaos and disaster, but harmony and hope. All chaos is caused by things outside that freedom suppressing freedom. In that freedom, man sees the desire to unite with God, the desire to consciously walk towards Truth. Human emotion, reason, and will inherently pursue Joy, Truth, and Freedom.

[^88]: 耶稣肯定宗教大法官并一切人的价值，从而在神性的支撑下，人生不是虚妄。你所爱的一切，都体现着上帝的荣耀和光辉，所以是值得赞颂的。人所能做的，就是接受这光，并且回归主的道路。
    > Jesus affirms the value of the Grand Inquisitor and all people. Supported by divinity, life is not vain. Everything you love embodies God's glory and radiance, and is thus worthy of praise. All man can do is accept this Light and return to the Lord's Way.

[^89]: 终曲即是耶稣的爱与生命之歌，也是最终真理的胜利之歌。其主题是赐予。
    > The Finale is Jesus' Song of Love and Life, and the Song of Victory of Ultimate Truth. Its theme is Bestowal.

[^90]: 耶稣就是要带给人摆脱罪的清白，从而将生命的芬芳喜悦给人。
    > Jesus wants to bring innocence that is free from sin, thereby giving the fragrant joy of Life to people.

[^91]: 所有众人，莫不是主的儿女，也莫不是救主的爱人。
    > All people are the Lord's children and the Savior's beloved.

[^92]: 耶稣的祝福在每个人里头，权柄也交给了他爱的一切众人。
    > Jesus' blessing is inside everyone, and authority is also given to all those He loves.

[^93]: 人们哀悼于耶稣，甘愿为耶稣一起负重，然而救世主将用他的权柄除去一切人的重负，带给他们至于馥郁的大爱。
    > People mourn for Jesus and are willing to bear the burden with Him. However, the Savior will use His authority to remove everyone's burden, bringing them fragrant Great Love.

[^94]: 在爱与生命的胜利里，黑暗就褪去了罢。
    > In the victory of Love and Life, darkness fades away.

[^95]: 在救赎的道路里，在赐予的爱里，人应当喜悦，歌唱而赞美上帝。
    > In the way of redemption and bestowed love, man should rejoice, sing, and praise God.

[^96]: 第二终曲首次节都是摘自科罗斯托克《复活颂歌》。
    > The first and second stanzas of the Second Finale are adapted from Klopstock's "Resurrection Ode" (Aufersteh'n).

[^97]: 对一切忧虑的，像大法官和伊万一样迷茫犹豫痛苦的，这里就指示清楚了，去生活吧！
    > To all who are anxious, confused, hesitant, and in pain like the Inquisitor and Ivan, here it is clearly indicated: Go and Live!

[^98]: 就是要人相信，进而坚信人的一切对上帝的追求和爱都是有价值的，是绝对肯定性的。
    > It is to make people believe, and firmly believe, that all human pursuit and love for God are valuable and absolutely affirmative.

[^99]: 人的生命是有价值的。
    > Human life is valuable.

[^100]: 人的死亡与复活，是一切虔信者坚定不移怀有的信念。
    > Human death and resurrection are the unwavering beliefs of all devout believers.

[^101]: 宣告着福音的胜利！
    > Proclaiming the victory of the Gospel!

[^102]: 人在这炽热的爱里头能够藉着自由而向上飞翔。
    > In this burning love, man can fly upwards through freedom.

[^103]: 同上解释。
    > Same explanation as above.

[^104]: 最终的信仰与追求将会使人亲自与上帝合一。
    > Ultimate faith and pursuit will lead man to personally unite with God.
