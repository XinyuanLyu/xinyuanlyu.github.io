## Economics
- **Health and Cognitive Consequences of Widowhood in Middle-aged and Elderly in China**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* This research utilizes China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data employing event study methodology to investigate the effects of widowhood on mortality risk, health, and cognitive function among middle-aged and elderly individuals in China. I did not find significant effects of widowhood on mortality risk. However, my results indicate a minor impact on physical health, primarily reflected in an increased probability of chronic diseases. Notably, there is a significant rise in the risk of depression and cognitive impairment, adversely affecting Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) capabilities and life expectancy. Further, I observe considerable heterogeneity in the negative effects of widowhood across different genders, urban-rural categories, and city sizes. However, no significant differences were found across varying levels of education and the number of children, suggesting that children cannot substitute the role of a spouse in post-widowhood life. The mechanism analysis reveals that individuals try to mitigate the negative impacts of widowhood by significantly increasing social activities, leisure, and the use of more medical resources. Additionally, remarriage in middle and old age might offset the adverse effects of widowhood.</p>

- **Personal Development and Living Conditions of First-Generation Migrant Workers in Later Life**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* This study examines the personal histories, health outcomes, and retirement conditions of the first generation of migrant workers in China, utilizing the CHARLS Life History Survey and other datasets. By analyzing a sample of 1,105 migrant workers alongside traditional farmers, county-based workers, and urban residents, this research explores the long-term impacts of migration and employment history on later-life well-being. Results indicate that migrant workers face distinct challenges, including health risks and financial insecurities, compared to non-migrant groups. The study identifies critical factors such as hukou transitions, multi-location living histories, and occupational characteristics that contribute to these disparities. Future work will expand the dataset to include multiple waves of CHARLS data and explore causal relationships between migrant worker identity and life outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into the implications of rural-urban migration and provides a foundation for policy development to improve the aging conditions of this population.</p>

- **Interventionism and the "Time" in the Causal Analysis in Historical Social Studies**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* When analyzing social science issues within the framework of interventionism, the problem of time effects inevitably arises. This paper focuses on the clarification of interventionism and the delineation of causal objects in the historical social studies, making time the central theme of the study. It indicates that a strictly defined intervention must necessarily and sufficiently control for time variable in order to control all potential confounding variables varying over time, leading to potential outcomes and causally possible worlds. Lastly, the paper critically analyzes the differences between treating time as a variable and object-in-time as history, the object itself, as well as the implications of these differences in interpretation. From this perspective, causal inference in historical social studies is further understood as the study of causally possible histories, emphasizing the rigor of interventions and the difference between internal and external validity. And therefore this kind of studies have their special meaning different from pure science, pure descriptive history, and just made-up fictions.</p>

## Computer Science & Data Science
- **Probabilistic Point Process Prediction**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are powerful tools for modeling event sequences with irregular timestamps, crucial in domains such as finance, healthcare, and social networks. This project builds on the classical Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process (RMTPP) model by introducing two probabilistic variants, RMTPP2 and RMTPP3, as well as a novel extension utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). RMTPP2 and RMTPP3 enhance the modeling of event uncertainty by incorporating stochastic elements into the intensity function. The GAN-based model further improves predictive performance by learning and generating realistic event sequences, subsequently applying transfer learning for accurate event type and timing predictions. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that these models outperform the baseline in temporal accuracy. This work bridges the gap between deterministic RNN-based TPP modeling and probabilistic generative paradigm, offering a promising direction for future advancements in event sequence prediction.</p>

## Philosophy

### Analytic philosophy & Logistics
- **Why We Should Still Against Sex Robots**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* This essay critiques the ethical implications of sex robots, particularly addressing the arguments supporting their development and use. While proponents like Levy argue that sex robots are akin to advanced sex toys and can enhance social utility without harm, critics emphasize their symbolic reinforcement of patriarchal norms, objectification of women, and the perpetuation of unethical sexual practices. The article engages with the Symbolic-Consequences Argument, which posits that sex robots symbolize problematic sexual norms and lead to negative societal outcomes. Responding to critiques like Danaher's, which question the immutability of these symbols and their consequences, the essay modifies the argument by rejecting a consequentialist framework. It asserts that, regardless of outcomes, commercialized sexual exchanges—including those involving robots—devalue basic human rights and dignity. The essay concludes that the development of sex robots remains ethically problematic unless robots achieve genuine autonomy and rights, fostering true human-machine relationships based on mutual respect.</p>

- **Biases, Schema and Correcting Algorithm**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* In this article, I will first talk about the ethical biases inherent in machine learning algorithms and explore what is meant by biases in this context, as well as how this bias is unique to machine learning. Furthermore, I will attempt to explicate the nature of the unique biases and its relationship with words, language and power structure. Finally, I will discuss a debiasing algorithm proposed by computer scientists, and taking this method as a guide, propose my own further thoughts and solutions.</p>

- **Revisiting Kripke's Critique of Descriptive Theories of Naming: Reflections on Necessity and Referential Rigidities**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* In Naming and Necessity, Saul Kripke critically challenges descriptive theories of naming, which argue that proper names refer to objects indirectly through clusters of descriptive properties. Kripke systematically deconstructs the descriptive theory by questioning its claims of necessity, uniqueness, and aprioricity, offering his own causal-historical account of reference. This paper examines Kripke's critique, focusing on his rejection of the necessary connection between objects and their descriptive properties and his defense of the rigidity of proper names across possible worlds. By reconstructing Kripke's arguments and exploring their foundational presuppositions, particularly his anti-essentialist stance toward objects, this study highlights the implications of his causal theory of reference. It further investigates whether Kripke's causal chain model guarantees the necessity of naming and proposes an alternative interpretation of referential certainty grounded in self-identity. Finally, the analysis situates Kripke's framework within the broader philosophical discourse, engaging with potential challenges to his presuppositions.</p>

- **Reflections on Putnam's Semantic Externalism: Analyzing 'Twin Earth' and Beyond**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* This paper critically reflects on Hilary Putnam's semantic externalism, as presented in his "Twin Earth" thought experiment, through the lens of Jesper Kallestrup's From Language to Thought. Putnam challenges semantic internalism by demonstrating that the meaning and reference of natural kind terms like "water" depend on external environmental factors rather than the speaker's internal mental states. This reflection revisits internalist responses to Putnam's argument, emphasizing the role of indexicality and socio-linguistic practices in shaping the meaning of natural kind terms. By extending the analysis, this paper introduces a generalizable framework for "C-class words," which depend on externally recognized properties not accessible through individual perception. The argument is further contextualized through examples like color terms in colorblind societies and medical terms defined by social norms. The conclusion suggests that semantic externalism highlights not only the relationship between language and thought but also broader metaphysical connections between mind, language, and reality, proposing implications for ontology and epistemology.</p>

### Philosophy of Religion & Continental Philosophy

- **The Possibility and Necessity of a Nietzschean Religion Philosophy - A Comparative Study of Shestov and Nietzsche's Philosophies**  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">*Abstract:* This paper aims to provide a comparative analysis of the philosophies of Lev
Shestov and Friedrich Nietzsche, exploring whether the tragic and religious
philosophies proposed by Shestov offer a viable and potentially superior alternative to
Nietzsche’s anti-nihilistic stance. The paper begins by examining the shared theme of
nihilism in both philosophers’ works, and meticulously outlines how Nietzsche and
Shestov define and critique the two facets of nihilism: the ancient religious and moral
systems and modern rationalism, which represent a denial of life and the will to power
(i.e., freedom) and a submission to necessity, respectively. Based on this foundation, the paper details Shestov’s proposed path to overcoming nihilism, illustrating a
trajectory from the failure of nihilism to tragic philosophy to religious philosophy, ultimately pointing to Shestov’s authentic faith that opens towards God as the absolute
creative force in the struggle. Finally, the paper analyzes Nietzsche's concepts of the
will to power and the doctrine of eternal recurrence, presenting Shestov’s critique of
Nietzsche. Through a reconsideration of Nietzsche’s eternal recurrence and amor fati, the paper ultimately identifies Shestov’s misunderstandings of Nietzsche’s philosophy
and reveals that Shestov’s rebellion against necessity might not provide a more
successful intellectual route than Nietzsche’s. Consequently, the paper concludes that
while Shestov’s Nietzschean-inspired religious philosophy is plausible in terms of
opposing and avoiding nihilism, it may not be necessary other than Nietzsche’s
philosophy in offering a definitive solution to overcoming nihilism.</p>
